##  Future Plans
*   split up the syllabus and the curriculum for this package:
    *   the syllabus notes down things that need to be learned and outcomes that should be achieved
    *   the curriculum collates and orders the material needed to cover the syllabus
    *   makes it easy to look for better materials and make updates to the curriculum, while making sure the scope of the training package doesnâ€™t drift too much
    *   â€‹â€‹but itâ€™s more effort than I feel is justified right now; after all weâ€™re CSIT not MOE
*   deep learning in the ML module
