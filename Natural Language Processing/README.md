*   [Stemmers and Lemmatisation (section 3.6)](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch03.html#sec-normalizing-text)
*   [Tokenising and Segmentation (sections 3.7 and 3.8)](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch03.html#sec-tokenization)
*   [POS Tagging (sections 1 and 2)](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html)

### Word Embeddings
*   [fastText](https://pypi.org/project/fasttext/)
*   [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/tutorial.html)

### Practical Application

##  Assessment
This section is a hands-on assessment that requires officers to attempt the Kaggle Avito Duplicate Ads Detection prediction competition. Officers are expected to write their own codes from scratch using concepts learnt from Kaggle Titanic and NLP methods (e.g. word2vec). Consequently, officers have to present the codes to the GL.
