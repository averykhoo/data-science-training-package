# Data Scientist Syllabus: zero to ~~hero~~ 0.5

50% of the bare minimum, in 5% of the time

* *"Appreciate the existence of"* means:
    * Know that this thing exists and roughly what it does
    * But it's _not_ necessary to know how or why it works
* ~~Strikethrough~~ means:

## Data Wrangling, EDA, Visualization, Cleaning

* Splitting data into a training/validation set and a "sacred" test set, avoiding leakage
* *(WIP) Featurization*
    * Handling data types
        * Categorical features - usually encoded
            * Unique labels / categories with insanely high cardinality are usually dropped
            * One-hot encoding (for categories of reasonably low cardinality - or use -1 and 1, and 0 for missing
              values)
            * Ordinal encoding for things like likert scales (but be warned that how these are interpreted sometimes
              vary from person to person, so their survey responses may not be comparable - only the differences between
              responses to questions may be valid)
        * Numerical features - sometimes quantized or normalized
            * Discretization/quantization/binning (equal-frequency, equal-width, clustering, handmade lookup table,
              etc.)

            * ~~Log-linearizing~~
        * Constructed features - when the base features can be made sense of in more ways
            * e.g., "is this guest a noble?" or "is this guest a domestic helper?" for titanic
            * *Appreciate the existence of: using proxy variables when "true" values are unavailable*
    * Imputation of null values
    * Feature importance and selection (SHAP, permutation)
    * gotchas to avoid
        * negative effects of having strongly-correlated features (in some models)
        * accidentally introducing time (e.g., via sequential ids, or shadows in labeled images of tanks)

    * ~~VC dimension~~
    * ~~Auto-encoders~~
