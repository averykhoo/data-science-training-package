# Functional Competencies (in progress)

* Machine Learning
    * Machine learning is the study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. It involves using
      statistical models and algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in data, and using this knowledge to make
      predictions about new data. Machine learning competencies include the ability to choose and apply appropriate
      algorithms, fine-tune model hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance.

* Analytics
    * Data analytics is the process of using data to generate insights and inform decision-making. It involves
      collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data, and using statistical and data storytelling/visualization techniques to
      identify trends, patterns, and relationships. Data analytics competencies include the ability to perform
      statistical analyses, create effective data visualizations, and communicate findings to a variety of audiences
      through data storytelling/visualization.

* Engineering
    * Data engineering is the practice of building and maintaining the infrastructure and processes needed to store,
      transform, and analyze data. It involves extracting data from various sources, designing efficient data pipelines,
      and choosing appropriate storage technologies. Data engineering competencies include the ability to extract and
      transform data from various sources, store and manage data effectively, and design efficient data pipelines.

* Communication
    * Data visualization is the process of creating visual representations of data to communicate insights and
      facilitate understanding. It involves choosing appropriate visual encodings, design principles, and visualization
      tools, and creating visually effective and accurate visualizations. Data visualization competencies include the
      ability to create a wide range of data visualizations, choose appropriate visual encodings and design principles,
      and use visualization tools effectively.
    * Data storytelling is the art of communicating data-driven insights and ideas in a way that is engaging,
      compelling, and easy to understand. It involves choosing appropriate data and visualization techniques to tell a
      story, and communicating the story in a clear and concise manner. Data storytelling competencies include the
      ability to identify relevant data and insights, choose appropriate data and visualization techniques, and
      communicate data-driven stories effectively.

* Processing Text and Speech
    * Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between
      computers and human (natural) languages. It involves using computational techniques to process and analyze text
      data, including tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging. Competencies in NLP include the
      ability to perform a wide range of text processing tasks, use appropriate computational techniques, and interpret
      the results of these tasks.
    * Speech Processing focuses specifically on the analysis of spoken language. It involves
      using computational techniques to process and analyze speech data, including tasks such as speech recognition,
      speaker identification, and language identification. Competencies in speech processing include the ability to
      perform a wide range of speech processing tasks, use appropriate computational techniques, and interpret the
      results of these tasks.

* Business Acumen/Insight
    * Business acumen is the understanding and knowledge of how an organization's operations work and how they can be
      optimized. It involves understanding business operations, strategies, and goals, and using data to inform
      decision-making. Business insight is the ability to see patterns and relationships in data that inform operational
      improvements. Competencies in operations acumen and insight include the ability to understand business operations
      and use data to inform decision-making, and the ability to identify patterns and relationships in data that inform
      operational improvements.
