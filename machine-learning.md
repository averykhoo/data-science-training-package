### ML = Representation + Evaluation + Optimization (section 2)
*   [link to pdf](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)

**see also this image**
![Representation, Evaluation, and Optimization steps for 5 different ML approaches](reo.png)
    *   Symbolists = knowledge-based systems
    *   Connectionists = neural nets
    *   Evolutionaries = genetic algorithms (not as relevant to data science)
    *   Bayesians = bayes nets / expert systems
    *   Analogizers = support vector machines

##  Tutorials
### Introduction to ML with scikit-learn
*   https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html

### Supervised learning with scikit-learn
*   https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/supervised_learning.html

### Choosing the right estimator (for information)
*   https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html

##  Available Toolkits (for information)

*   scikit-learn
*   XGBoost
*   Vowpal Wabbit

**More obscure tools**

*   LightGBM / CatBoost
*   Regularized Greedy Forest
*   libFM / fastFM
*   H2O

##  Deep Learning
*   someday weâ€™ll add something using a GPU
*   probably use MNIST or build word vectors with a small dataset


#   Practical (2 weeks)
*   Officer to improve on the Kaggle Titanic codes given in the guided explanation
